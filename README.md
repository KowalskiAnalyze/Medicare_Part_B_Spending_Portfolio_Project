# Medicare Part B: Regional and National Spending Patterns (2018–2022)

## Background & Overview
Established in 1965, Medicare is a vital federal program that provides access to affordable medical services for over 67 million beneficiaries. It is primarily funded through payroll taxes, general federal revenues, and enrollee premiums. Because it’s publicly funded, every dollar spent must be justified to maintain a balance between patient access, cost-efficiency, and long-term sustainability.

Medicare is divided into four parts—this project focuses on Part B, which covers outpatient services, including physician visits, preventive care, and durable medical equipment (DME) such as wheelchairs, glucose monitors, and other essential supplies.

This analysis uses publicly available datasets from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), detailing Medicare Part B spending on DME and supplies from 2018 to 2022, broken down by state and HCPCS code.

The goal is to evaluate national and regional spending behavior using the following key performance indicators (KPIs):

- **Medicare Spending per HCPCS Code**
- **Total Yearly National Medicare Part B Spending**
- **Total Number of Suppliers per Region**
- **Average Supplier Medicare Payment Amount**
- **Supplier Vs Medicare Charge Comparison**
- **Medicare Payment Coverage Rate**
- 
Analysis and recommendations are provided on the following key areas:

- **Regional Comparisons:** *Evaluate which states drive the highest Medicare spending and identify regional outliers.*
- **Yearly Spending Trends:** *Track how total Medicare Part B spending has changed year-over-year to highlight rising costs or improved efficiencies.*
- **Supplier Behavior and Pricing:** *Examine gaps between supplier-submitted charges, Medicare-approved rates, and actual Medicare payments to flag irregular pricing practices.*
- **High-Cost Item Concentration:** *Evaluate which DME and medical supplies account for the largest share of national spending.*

## Executive Summary

### Overview of Findings

Explain the overarching findings, trends, and themes in 2-3 sentences here. This section should address the question: "If a stakeholder were to take away 3 main insights from your project, what are the most important things they should know?" You can put yourself in the shoes of a specific stakeholder - for example, a marketing manager or finance director - to think creatively about this section.

## Assumptions and Caveats:

Throughout the analysis, multiple assumptions were made to manage challenges with the data. These assumptions and caveats are noted below:

* Assumption 1 (ex: missing country records were for customers based in the US, and were re-coded to be US citizens)
  
* Assumption 1 (ex: data for December 2021 was missing - this was imputed using a combination of historical trends and December 2020 data)
  
* Assumption 1 (ex: because 3% of the refund date column contained non-sensical dates, these were excluded from the analysis)
